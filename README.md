# E-commerce-project
building the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code and configuring a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a PostgreSQL database. I worked on this project with my tutor, Robert Kurle Jr., on Monday, April 1st, 2024. First I created the relationships in models/index.js. Then I defined the columns in the rest of the models in the model folder. Then I worked on creating the correct get,post, create, and delete routes for category-routes and tag-routes. Then I did the same for the get, put, and delete routes for product-routes. Then I worked in server.js to synchronize the server with sequelize and postgres. Finally I personally tested all the routes before creating the video walkthrough for the application.
